description1: <p style="text-align:centered"> This portfolio contains an environment called V-Nav (Virtual Navigation) created in the Unity3D framework. I used Unity3D game engine to manually design scenes with common urban structures and add freely available 3D assets, representing foreground classes, to the scene. Manually generating the scene facilitates in generating annotations such as pixel wise labels very easily, Which eliminates the need for manually labaelling images for training a network. <b><i>The main purpose of designing this environment was to collect images to create a custom Synthetic Dataset of an Urban Environment, which can be used to train Neural Networks for various Computer Vision Applications<i><b>.</p>
description2: <p style="text-align:left">FEATURES-<br/>  - Sufficiently large Urban Environment- that can be used in a game scene or for collection of images for a synthetic dataset.<br/> - Contains a Custom Built Stereo Vision Camera script in C# (Shown in sample image 4).<br/> - Standard car model for easy navigation.<br/> - Unity images Synthesis Library for easy generation of depth maps, normals etc is included.<br/> - Easily Customizable by end user, as various free to use assets are included in the project.<br/> - Post Processing effects such as ambient occulusion, color grading and vignette have been used to beautify the environment. (can be turned off if needed)</p>
description3: As can be seen from the sample images and demo video V-Nav is still under active construction. Although V-Nav does not have photo-realistic textures like those of AAA game titles, it can be of good use for creating game levels for starting out Indie Game Developers and also for researchers looking actively to collect a viable synthetic data set of an urban seeting from an environment ie Completely Open Source.
